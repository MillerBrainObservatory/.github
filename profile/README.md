<h1> Miller Brain Observatory </h1>
 
<h4> The Miller Brain Observatory <strong>(RBO)</strong> is a collaborative research center at the Rockefeller University with a core mission to enable 
  access to cutting edge optical neurotechologies for the advancement of biological discoveries.</h4>

<p>Originally sponsored and founded in 2022 by the Kavli Neural Systems Institute and supported by a generous commitment from a family foundation in 2024, the vision of the MBO is to refine, disseminate, and provide long-term support of cutting edge optical neurotechnologies to serve a wide range of biological contexts. The MBO maintains custom pre-commercial microscopes, data pipelines, and computational resources to collaboratively address challenging scientific projects.</p>
